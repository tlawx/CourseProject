## Search System For Hospital Transparency Data

Healthcare costs make up one of individuals and employers largest expenses and prices continue to rise. New legislation in recent years has required hospitals to provide medical services price transparency by 2023. This data is accessible on hospital websites but not easily accessible to individuals searching by service. 

This project allows users to query/search of medical service and provide a list of hospitals that are ranked according to reported prices and their ratings
